    <h1>Purchase Agreement</h1>
      <p>All orders that are placed through our website are subject to the mentioned terms and conditions. By placing an order, it is understood that you have read, comprehended and agreed with our terms and conditions.<br />
<br />
All orders are placed into the advertising rotation within 24 to 72 hours depending on our daily traffic order volume. It excludes orders placed during the weekends. All weekend orders will be filled on the next business day. During peak season, the time frame to start an order can take up to 72 hours. Due to variances in amount of traffic purchased at different times, the starting date may fluctuate, and we are in no way to be held responsible if your campaign does not start by a specific date.<br />
<br />
All Traffic is sent AS IS with no guarantee of converting into sales. All campaigns are considered active, the moment the first visitor, hit or traffic is delivered to the client site.<br />
<br />
All traffic will be delivered to the website address submitted with the order. In an event where there is an error with the submitted URL, the client will not hold us responsible for the error. Any traffic delivered to the client's site reflecting the above error will not be credited or entitled to a refund.<br />
<br />
We guarantee to deliver the number of ordered visitors to the specified URL within 60 days or less of the campaign start date. This is the only guarantee for this traffic service. We shall not be liable for any consequential, direct, indirect, incidental, punitive or other damages arising out of the use of the traffic package.<br />
<br />
If we are unable to deliver the number of visitors promised within 60 days of the campaign starting date, you may request for a partial refund on a pro-rata basis. All the refund requests are thoroughly investigated and we reserve a right to approve or decline your request.<br />
<br />
In an event that the client's site becomes unavailable for any reason like server is, timed out, active but with internal server error and 404 errors, the client will not hold us responsible for these errors. Any traffic delivered to the client's site during this down time will not be credited or refunded. In an event that any of the above errors occur including any errors that are not listed but clearly intended, the client may submit a request to put the campaign on hold. Upon resolution of the problem, the held campaign will continue. Any traffic previously sent will not be credited or refunded.<br />
<br />
We use a state of the art tracking system to track your ad campaign. Each order is given a unique campaign id, which is used to track visitors to your site by day and time. The client understands that if the visitor viewing the ad closes it before it finishes loading, which could be due to network bandwidth, high impact graphics, animation or lack of interest, it will count as an ad view on our system. In other words, we have sent your site to the visitor and have therefore fulfilled our obligation. It is important to note that this scenario may not appear in your website statistics.<br />
<br />
When you purchase a traffic campaign, you understand and agree that the statistics system utilized by us will serve as the official record of traffic delivered. We will not be held responsible for traffic not received on your campaign page but sent from our ad server during down.<br />
<br />
We do not allow campaign pages with any kind of popup windows, exit windows or any other kind of extra generated windows including system message windows and Java Script alert windows, unless specified in the package description. Any additional window generated by your site shall be considered a popup window. You may not use any Java Script to modify the window size. Your campaign page may not have any music or Java applets on the page. Attempting to use any Java Script that change people's homepages or add your website to their favorites is prohibited. If a popup window is installed on the URL at any time, we will stop the campaign and you will not be entitled to a refund.<br />
<br />
Client understands that traffic counters on their site do not accurately represent the number of visitors sent to their website. This is due to the large amounts of traffic sent to the site in a relatively short timeframe. Client also understands that we do not guarantee sales or sign ups and will not issue a refund if none are achieved. We will send visitors to your site, which is the only guarantee for this service.<br />
<br />
Client acknowledges that the order is for the stated term. These terms and conditions are subject to change at any time after the stated term has ended.<br />
<br />
Client may not sell, assign or transfer any of the rights or services accompanying the purchase. Client may not have any type of pop up advertising on the web site being promoted by us unless a package was ordered for the same. Client may not change the content of the URL being advertised in any manner without prior approval by our authorized staff. Any attempt either by accident or design undermining the intention of our service terms and conditions will result in immediate account deletion with no refund or adjustments available.<br />
<br />
In the event that there is a discrepancy between the amount of traffic delivered by us and the amount of traffic delivered to the client, the client agrees to use the report prepared by our campaign manager.<br />
<br />
Support staff is available virtually 24 hours a day. All requests must be made via email, phone call and live chat. Client also understands that technical support may be unavailable at times when the client initiates a contact. It is our policy to respond to all emails within 24 hours.<br />
<br />
We shall be permitted to use the client's name in connection with our marketing materials. Subject to the prior approval of our client, we may elect to issue a joint press release announcing the client's marketing partnership with us. <br />
<br />
We will not promote spam, scam, hate, pornography, warez, hacking or any other site/offer that could be considered offensive to the common viewer. Any attempt to bypass our intended guidelines will result in account cancellation and no recourse for refund.<br />
<br />
We will not deliver general traffic to a website containing content that is not appropriate for viewing by general audience unless you specifically order casino or adult traffic. Inappropriate content when delivering traffic includes adult content, hate text, illegal content and content that encourages illegal activities or violence. What constitutes inappropriate content will be determined by the staff members of our company.<br />
<br />
We will review your site before beginning the campaign. If your site is changed during the campaign and starts displaying inappropriate content, we will stop your campaign immediately. In this case, you will not be provided a refund on a pro-rata basis.<br />
<br />
We cannot be held responsible for factors beyond our control that may interfere with our ability to deliver visitors to your website. Such factors include downtime on your server, overuse of your bandwidth quota, errors on your site, popup killers and network outages. Please contact your web hosting company or network provider if you are unsure about whether your hosting account is sufficient for the program you are ordering.<br />
<br />
If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any jurisdiction or government agency, that particular provision will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to make the provision valid and enforceable, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.<br />
<br />
We will no longer accept URL's ending in .co.cc as 100% of the domains were virus infected and fraudulent.<br />
<br />
We will not allow invasive 3rd party ad company to piggyback on our network. These include adf.ly and a few others. We will notify the client if there is a piggyback problem.<br />
<br />
Sites that contain Java pops can only run in our Run of Network (RON) and will be limited to a daily cap of 1000 visitors. A Java pop is an annoyance that prevents a user from leaving the website without clicking in some type of window. It is highly advised that you consult your customers beforehand and request a link that does not result in annoyance.<br />
<br />
All adult related websites promoting toys, erotic dating etc. must run in the mature network.<br />
<br />
While we gladly welcome sound ads please pay attention to some of the conditions. Sound ads must run in a different network and traffic will be drastically slower at times as only 10% of our network sites run sound ads. Ads containing sound may only run in their respective language, geographical location or worldwide market. A Spanish sound ad can only run in predominate Spanish speaking geographical locations.<br />
<br />
We will deliver the traffic that is ordered by our client. We will use our own tracking system to determine the quantity of traffic that is sent to the client's website. We won't be liable if your website raw logs don't match with our tracking statistics. Our traffic is redirected traffic and your own web stats might not show all the visitors that are redirected. We are not responsible for any improper use of our client's program, information, links, articles or any other content available on their website.<br />
<br />
For country targeted traffic orders, we have an IP database and a script that works with the database to determine visitor's country. We cannot guarantee that the traffic will be 100% targeted to the country you requested because ISP's use dynamic IP addresses. You hereby agree that we are not responsible if you receive visitors from other countries other than the targeted country. We will do our best to get you the most targeted traffic and this is the only guarantee for this service.<br />
<br />
Client acknowledges that by placing an order with us, they have read, acknowledged and fully understood all paragraphs of the mentioned terms and conditions.</p>
